# machine-learning-exemplified

Provides tutorial-like examples for prototyping machine learning models using various approaches.

1. open-class image classification: deep learning experiment to train a binary classifier that distinguishes between `class / not_class`. The non-triviality of the problem lies with the non-deterministic nature of one of the classes.
