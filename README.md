# machine-learning-exemplified

Provides tutorial-like examples for prototyping machine learning models using various approaches.

1. open-class image classification: deep learning experiment to train a binary classifier that distinguishes between `class / not_class`. The non-triviality of the problem lies with the non-deterministic nature of one of the classes. A dataset will never contain enough information of the real world to capture the complete meaning of `not_class`.

2. cluster-visualisation: use of [t-SNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/) dimensionality reduction to visualise images of Ferrari, Jeep, and Bentley cars from the [Stanford cars dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html)
